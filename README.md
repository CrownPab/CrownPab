# About Me 🧑🏾
---

I am Gagan Pabla, recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. Currently I am looking for software engineering roles within fast-paced and innovative companies. I’m a Full Stack Developer with one year of web development experience obtained over a series of internships completed during my undergraduate. I am living in Ontario, Canada but am open to relocating for the right role. As of now, I am focused on web application development and UI/UX design but I still wish to explore many fields within computer science.
